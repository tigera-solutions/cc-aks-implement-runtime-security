# Workshop: Microsoft AKS Security Bootcamp: </br> Implement runtime security

## Welcome

In this AKS-focused workshop, you will work with Microsoft Azure and Calico Cloud to learn how to protect containers in your Kubernetes cluster from known and zero-day threats based container and network attacks running on Microsoft AKS.

In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, the security of your AKS Kubernetes clusters is non-negotiable. This workshop equips you with the knowledge and skills to fortify your cluster's defenses comprehensively, ensuring the protection of critical workloads and sensitive data. It empowers you to customize security measures to fit your organization's unique requirements and keeps you ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.

Cybersecurity expertise is in high demand and mastering the art of securing Kubernetes environments is a valuable skill set. Whether you're an IT administrator, developer, or security professional, the insights gained in this workshop will enhance your proficiency and make you an invaluable asset to your organization. Additionally, by proactively implementing robust security practices, you can save your organization from potential financial losses and reputational damage that can result from security breaches. 

Don't miss this opportunity to bolster your security knowledge, protect your infrastructure, and advance your professional journey.

You will come away from this workshop with an understanding of how others in your industry are securing and observing cloud-native applications in Microsoft Azure, along with best practices that you can implement in your organization.

### Learning Objectives

- **Customize Security Guardrails**: Discover how to customize security guardrails to fortify your network against various threats.
- **Configure IDS/IPS and WAF**: Dive into the configuration of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and workload-centric Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to safeguard your cluster from network-based threats.
- **Zero-Day Attack Detection**: Learn how to detect zero-day attacks by monitoring suspicious container activity, enabling you to proactively respond to emerging threats.
- **Security Policy Enforcement**: Preview and enforce security policies to quarantine infected workloads, preventing the spread of threats within your Kubernetes environment.
- **Visualize Security Posture**: Learn how to effectively visualize the security posture of your Azure AKS cluster, allowing you to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

## Workshop Environment Preparation

> :warning: **For this workshop, you are expected to have access to a previously created AKS cluster.**

- Please, follow the instructions on the repository below if you don't have it ready: 

  [Calico Cloud on AKS - Workshop Environment Preparation](https://github.com/tigera-solutions/aks-workshop-prep)

- We will run this workshop from the Azure Cloud Shell, as described in that repository.

- To start your cluster, reload the environment variables create in your Azure Cloud Shell first and then start the cluster. Use the following command:

  ```bash
  source ~/workshopvars.env
  az aks start --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name $CLUSTERNAME
  ```
